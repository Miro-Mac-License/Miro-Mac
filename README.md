## Overview

<a href="#">Miro for macOS</a> is designed for teams who treat whiteboards as living project spaces instead of one-off meeting artefacts. Boards can be used to capture discovery, map user journeys, define architectures or coordinate roadmaps, all in the same workspace. Templates and reusable frameworks keep common ceremonies—like retros, planning or opportunity mapping—consistent across squads. By running Miro as a desktop app, macOS users can keep key boards pinned and ready, rather than buried in browser tabs.

Collaboration tools are tuned for both synchronous workshops and asynchronous contribution. Cursors, comments and timers support live sessions, while sticky notes, shapes and connectors make it easy to layer structure onto chaotic early thinking. With <a href="#">frame-based navigation</a>, large boards stay manageable, helping facilitators guide participants through a sequence of steps. Integrations with issue trackers and docs mean final decisions can be exported into execution systems without losing context.

On macOS, Miro fits comfortably into a multi-window workflow where designers, PMs and engineers juggle browsers, Figma, terminals and communication apps. Notifications highlight when collaborators mention you or update critical boards, but the app stays focused on the canvas rather than overwhelming the desktop. Over time, teams can treat Miro as a visual operating system for their projects, returning to the same maps and diagrams as living references instead of disposable slides.
